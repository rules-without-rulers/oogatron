// Full recompute after every event-writing sync: one batch, milliseconds of
// SQLite time at this project's scale (< ~5k events), and it eliminates the
// incremental-invalidation bug class entirely (late-arriving events, bot
// reclassification, edited payloads). Revisit around ~100k events.
//
// Merge dedupe: a merged PR is one credit for the merger (its 'merge' event).
// The auto-generated merge commit on the branch would credit them a second
// time, so any commit whose oid is some same-repo merge event's mergeCommit
// is excluded here. Raw events stay complete for audit; only rollups (and
// the raw recompute in api/contributors.ts, which repeats this predicate)
// serve deduplicated numbers.
